# Welcome to The Chronlogue API, a project by The Good Docs team

To start the web api, do the following
```bash
# install all dependencies 
npm install
# start the api
npm start
# run test api HTTP requests
npm run test
```
If you use VSCode, install the plugin ESLint and Prettier to integrate the API workflow nicely with VSCode.
